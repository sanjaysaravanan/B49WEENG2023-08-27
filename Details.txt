  Window Utilities:
    Storage:
      localStorage:
        has no expiry the data put in stays on forever untill we manualy clean wither via code, or in browser
      sessionStorage
        data stored in sessionStorage gets removed after closing the page session --> tab

  Events:

    classlist toggle

    addEventListner:
      click --> div, button
      DOMContentLoaded --> document
      mouseover --> any
      mouseleave --> any
      change --> input
      submit --> form


    removeEventListener -- events can only be removed with named callback function

    options in eventListener:
      once: boolean value to tell whether event should execute only once

    2. Concepts in events

      1. Propagation --> events propagate through inner <-> outer between related elements

      Way of Propagation:
        1. Default - Bubbling (inner to outer or child to parent) ---> propagation of events from innerMost child to outermost parent 
        2. Capturing (outer to inner) ---> event progation of events from outermost parent to innermost child

        stopProgation func for an event:
  
  Callback:

    callback function ---> a function reference/definition which is used an arguement to another function to execute a set of statements

    Disadvantage Of Callback:
      callback hell


  Example Task:
    Count backwards from 10 to 1, then say Happy Indep

Tasks:

  Day 14:

    Try Only Pagination Task: Refer the Pagination Image
      Start the Task and try completing it, On Saturday( 2023-09-02 )
      Will discuss on the test-case then You can submit the task

      https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O8yVCwB_GaY5rZK1_mNkZ9GeYJLeom_dYmcVN3Mb2ws/edit

      Will explain and help in including test suite - Point 5 in Task Details
    
    Rest of the Task You can start on Saturday(2023-09-02) Afternoon

  Day 15: Callback Hell Bakward Counter - Complete and Submit on or Before (2023-09-02) 
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K6jW6TPmqWvzoRAm2t-GlOAxKmMRsLt5zaCsdcH_3LM/edit

Next Session:
    table creation

    id, class, nested structure, keys to pass test case 

    Discussion for Task
      Pagination:
        how to pass test cases
      calculator:
        use eval for infx expresiion valuation
        eval('2+2*(2)');

      Form: 
        1. How to take form values to JS  


    sync operations exectution:
      Eg: forEach, map, filter, find

    async operations execution ( operation running in background )
      Eg: setTimout ( wait for sometime to execute )
          setInterval ( executes frequently after certain interval )
          element.addEventListner(type, listern: callback);

    Javascript is a single thread 
    
    async operations are put into a queue after the wait time/ or completion of action.
    then js grabs them from the callback queue for execution

    use & purpose of the callback

    callback advantages:
      1. Modularity / Reusability
      2. To keep track when to execute what statements as a callback in a asynchronous operation

      asynchronous operation always go for named callback function to keep track

    pain of callback
      Callback Hell: Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. Every callback depends/waits for the previous callback, thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the readability and maintainability of the code
